Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the
videos or the solutions for help?

    This section of the particularly helpful to understand grid, I think some of them I was able to figureout but most of them I use the videos to guide me.

How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one
exercise that was particularly helpful?

    I found them really helpful, but I believe that the second excercise was the most useful and helpful to understand how to structure a grid.

Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

    I am not sure if this is part of the topic list but I think it would be interesting to see a bigger example with more objects being put inside the grid elements, for example like buttons or information, images, etc.

Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weekâ€™s
topic a little better?

    I don't think so, this was really helpful. Thank you.
