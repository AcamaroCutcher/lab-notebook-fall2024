Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the
videos or the solutions for help?

    I was not, I was really confused as to how to make the form, so have the videos was really helpful!

How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one
exercise that was particularly helpful?

    It was really helpful, I have little experience with html so this example open up new options and possibilities.

Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

    I am not sure, I think that I am just a bit slow and was not able to understand it really well.

Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weekâ€™s
topic a little better?

    Maybe some more examples of forms would have been cool, since there is only one html file for this lab section.
