Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the
videos or the solutions for help?

I was able to practice on the online game before completing this excercise, so it was helpful to understand how to this. I think that I was mostly able to figure this out. The only part that I got stuck at was the with the boxes of multiple hight, I was not completly sure how align them and format their location initially but after watching the video it was really straight forward.

How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one
exercise that was particularly helpful?

    I found them really helpful, specially the video about the multiple box heights.

Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

    I would like to see content being added into these boxed so that I can get more experience with that aspect.

Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weekâ€™s
topic a little better?

    I think this was enought, along side the video game it make it really fun to learn.
