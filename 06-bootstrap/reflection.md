Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the
videos or the solutions for help?

    I was not able to solve them completly on my own, so it was helpful to have video for the excercises to help me get unstuck.

How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one
exercise that was particularly helpful?

    I think all of them were really helpful however, the cards and the modal were really useful to get to know more what can be done and how to use bootstrap.

Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

    I would have liked to know more about bootstrap fuctionality, specially how to use grid with other aspects, like photos or buttons inside of them, etc.

Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weekâ€™s
topic a little better?

    I am not sure, I think there were really useful. Thank you for making them.
