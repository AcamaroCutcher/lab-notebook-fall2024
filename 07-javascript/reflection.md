Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the
videos or the solutions for help?

    I used most of the videos for help. I was able to do some of the functional part of the excercises by myself.

How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one
exercise that was particularly helpful?

    I found the really helpful, becuase I was very confused how to do anything. I think the fetch excercise was the most helpful.

Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

    I think it would be helpful to have more information about the DOM and how to connect it with javascript but that just might be my confusion.

Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weekâ€™s
topic a little better?

    I am not sure, maybe more content on interactivity and what more of a general view of what can be done with javascript would have been really nice.
