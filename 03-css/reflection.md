Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the
videos or the solutions for help?

    I think was able to complete some of the excercises specially the ones with specificity. After I played the video game and was able to learn how to use it, it made it easy to understand and it was fun.

How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one
exercise that was particularly helpful?

    I think that the position and media queries are particularly helpful to learn html, well, at least I found them interesting. Why I say this is because I was very confused as to how to use the media queries and position, so these videos help me clear my confusion up.

Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

    I am not sure, I would have liked more examples in the layout, with some content.

Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weekâ€™s
topic a little better?

    I am not sure, it think that these excercises were really helpful and complete.
